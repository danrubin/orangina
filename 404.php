					<p><strong><em>&#8220;What the heck is an Error 404?&#8221;</em></strong> you ask?</p>

					<p>Roughly translated, it means &#8220;The file or page you requested was not found by the server&#8221;, but that doesn't really do you any good, does it?</p>

					<p>My suggestion is to check the address in your web browser and try again (you never know when those nasty little typos will show up), or visit the <a href="/">home page</a> and start from scratch. If you think there's actually a chance (slim though it may be) that something is broken on this site, please <a href="/contact/">drop me a line about it</a> with as much cool-sounding technical jargon as possible.</p>

					<p>What, not satisfied with those options? Well then, take a gander at these: above (hidden at the top of the page -- you'll figure it out), you can search the entire site archives; below, you'll find links to recent entries on this blog, as well as the main site navigation up top. If that's not enough for you (picky bastard), I also have some nice, fresh external links over on the right. <em>Still</em> not enough? Perhaps <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a> might have something better...</p>
